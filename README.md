# Agile Development

> We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:
>
>- **Individuals and interactions** over _processes and tools_
>- **Working software** over _comprehensive documentation_
>- **Customer collaboration** over _contract negotiation_
>- **Responding to change** over _following a plan_
>
> That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
>

## Expectations

### Shifting Plans

You will be working as a team on a 5-week project with unclear objectives.  As a team and as individuals you will need to be prepared for shifting plans and goals.  The plans you lay in the first week will certainly change as you gain experience with the technologies, understand the project's needs, and learn the strengths (and limits) of your team members.

This is to be expected, embrace it!

### Team Roles

It is not possible for everyone to understand everything in this project.  Each team member will need to take ownership of one part of the project, they do not need to write all of the code for their part but will need to review all PR's and will have final say on any technical decisions.  Here are some recommended roles, see if these make sense for your team:

- Project Owner: Generally the strongest developer on the team, they are expected to keep an eye on the entire project's progress and technical quality.  They are responsible for the on-time delivery of a quality project.
- Dev-Ops: The team member responsible for the live deployment. They will have final decisions on all questions related to CI/CD and hosting.
- UX/UI: This team member has final responsibility for decisions that impact the user's experience on the website.  This role is not as simple as drawing wireframes! They will need to be in close contact with everyone at every step of the way, the suggestions you make must be realistic for your team mates to develop in the time that you have.
- Frontend: Ultimately responsible for the frontend code, this team member will have final say on decisions related to code organization, styling dependencies, and third-party libraries.  You will need to work very closely with those responsible for UX/UI and backend.
- Backend: Ultimately responsible for the project's API and data schemas, you will need to work closely with the Frontend owner to make sure your routes and schemas align with their code, and with the Dev-Ops to make sure your backend is compatible with the project's Continuous Deployment.

No matter what role you take, you will still be exepcted to help develop the backlog of issues and review your team mates PRs.

### Process over Product

You are still learning!  The primary objective in this module is to learn how to work together on a larger project.  This process is more important the final product.  It's okay if by the end of the module your application only has only one or two user stories. As long as those user stories are the result of a successful team dynamic it will be a success.

### Exploring Technologies

This module is your opportunity to explore new or interesting web technologies, don't be limited by the start code we provide!  Feel free to explore new technologies individually and as a team. (as long as it doesn't set you behind schedule ;)

## Deliverables

This module is all about delivering! By the end of your 5 weeks your team needs to be ready to pitch your project at graduation.  You will be expected to deliver:

### Contributor-Friendly Repo

Working code is not enough!  Your team will need to produce a contributor-friendly repository.  If you work carefully over the 5 weeks this will not be much extra work.  A good repository will include:

- A complete README with all the information someone needs to run the project locally
- Code of conduct
- Contributor Guidelines
- License
- Clearly organized and working code on the master branch
- An overview of how the code is organized and where to find what
- Well defined issues for contributors to select
- Well-managed branches
- A defined PR and Code Review process

### Minimal Viable Product

A live URL with a live demo of your project: no bugs!  no broken features!

This demo can be very simple and limited, you won't be evaluated on how complex it is.  Instead you will be evaluated on whether or not _each and every_ feature on the demo works and how much value these features add for the user. In the final week of the project your team will need to assess which features can be finished on time and which cannot.  Features that cannot be finished on time should be removed from the deployment branch and kept in the backlog.

If your team has been disciplined about branching, code review and deployment throughout the project, the MVP should be ready without any extra work.

### Landing Page

Create a [landing page](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-a-landing-page/) for your app.  This should be a beautiful and simple single-page site that explains why a user would want to use your app and how to get started.  It should include a link to your live demo.

You are encouraged to write this using only HTML & CSS (/bootstrap/material/...) for simplicity, no need for a full frontend framework.  Your landing page can be hosted from your group repository using GitHub Pages.

### Video Spot

Produce a short (< 2min) video spot explaining your project.  The goal of this spot is to sell your app to new users.  You should not mention the technologies you used, show the code, or talk about how it was built.  You might not even include a screen shot of the app!

Think of the adds you'd see on Youtube, this is what you're aiming for. Be creative, be engagin, be convincing.

### Pitch Deck

Create a short slide show to explain your project in under 2 minutes.  Your audience is a potential user, you will need to convince them of:

- why they want to use your service
- why it is better than other alternatives
- why you are the best team for the job

### Presentation

Finally, your team will need to present all of this on graduation day.  Divide the presentation among yourselves, each team member should speak at least once.  Things you may want to mention in your presentation:

- who is on your team
- what you built and why
  - screen shots of the landing page
  - embed the video spot
- screen shots/gifs of the live demo
- about your journey
  - development process
  - what you learned
  - what was challenging
  - what was fun
  - ...
- ... this is your project, be proud of yourselves :)

## Week 1

In the first week you will become familiar with the starter repository and lay out your plans for the next 4 weeks.  Agile does not mean "no planning"!

You will define your user, plan their journey through your application, develop wireframes, and set up an initial backlog of development tasks.  You will change the plans in the coming weeks as you better understand your team and the project, but that doesn't mean it's wasted time.  That's the agile way.

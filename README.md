# Agile Development

> We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

>- **Individuals and interactions** over _processes and tools_<br/>
Agile focus on the people that use the product and how they use it 
is extremely important. Because,teams always work best when they
pay attention to the human elements, that is called Human-centered 
design.There are three key area of Human-centered design: observation
, analysis and ideation.Like, one-on-one interviews(observation),
personas(analysis) and prototyping (ideation).
>- **Working software** over _comprehensive documentation_ <br/>
Agile value working software over comprehensive documentation—because 
 the most effective way for a user to gauge how well the
 product is actually by use it.Agile teams don't wait until the product 
 is perfect before sharing it with the people, they deliver the 
 working product quickly and improve it consistently.
>- **Customer collaboration** over _contract negotiation_ <br/>
Agile recognize that projects change, and that people never have 
perfect information when starting a project.
So instead of trying to nail down exactly what’s going to be built
 before they start, they collaborate with their users to try to get the best results.
>- **Responding to change** over _following a plan_ <br/>
It’s important to plan your project, but it’s even more
important to recognize that those plans will change once the team
starts working on the code.

> That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

## Expectations

### Shifting Plans

You will be working as a team on a 5-week project with unclear objectives.  As a team and as individuals you will need to be prepared for shifting plans and goals.  The plans you lay in the first week will certainly change as you gain experience with the technologies, understand the project's needs, and learn the strengths (and limits) of your team members.

This is to be expected, embrace it!

### Team Roles

It is not possible for everyone to understand everything in this project.  Each team member will need to take ownership of one part of the project, they do not need to write all of the code for their part but will need to review all PR's and will have final say on any technical decisions.  Here are some recommended roles, see if these make sense for your team:

- Project Owner: Generally the strongest developer on the team, they are expected to keep an eye on the entire project's progress and technical quality.  They are responsible for the on-time delivery of a quality project.
- Dev-Ops: The team member responsible for the live deployment. They will have final decisions on all questions related to CI/CD and hosting.
- UX/UI: This team member has final responsibility for decisions that impact the user's experience on the website.  This role is not as simple as drawing wireframes! They will need to be in close contact with everyone at every step of the way, the suggestions you make must be realistic for your team mates to develop in the time that you have.
- Frontend: Ultimately responsible for the frontend code, this team member will have final say on decisions related to code organization, styling dependencies, and third-party libraries.  You will need to work very closely with those responsible for UX/UI and backend.
- Backend: Ultimately responsible for the project's API and data schemas, you will need to work closely with the Frontend owner to make sure your routes and schemas align with their code, and with the Dev-Ops to make sure your backend is compatible with the project's Continuous Deployment.

No matter what role you take, you will still be exepcted to help develop the backlog of issues and review your team mates PRs.

### Process over Product

You are still learning!  The primary objective in this module is to learn how to work together on a larger project.  This process is more important the final product.  It's okay if by the end of the module your application only has only one or two user stories. As long as those user stories are the result of a successful team dynamic it will be a success.

### Exploring Technologies

This module is your opportunity to explore new or interesting web technologies, don't be limited by the start code we provide!  Feel free to explore new technologies individually and as a team. (as long as it doesn't set you behind schedule ;)

## Deliverables

This module is all about delivering! By the end of your 5 weeks your team needs to be ready to pitch your project at graduation.  You will be expected to deliver:

### Contributor-Friendly Repo

Working code is not enough!  Your team will need to produce a contributor-friendly repository.  If you work carefully over the 5 weeks this will not be much extra work.  A good repository will include:

- A complete README with all the information someone needs to run the project locally
- Code of conduct
- Contributor Guidelines
- License
- Clearly organized and working code on the master branch
- An overview of how the code is organized and where to find what
- Well defined issues for contributors to select
- Well-managed branches
- A defined PR and Code Review process

### Minimal Viable Product

A live URL with a live demo of your project: no bugs!  no broken features!

This demo can be very simple and limited, you won't be evaluated on how complex it is.  Instead you will be evaluated on whether or not _each and every_ feature on the demo works and how much value these features add for the user. In the final week of the project your team will need to assess which features can be finished on time and which cannot.  Features that cannot be finished on time should be removed from the deployment branch and kept in the backlog.

If your team has been disciplined about branching, code review and deployment throughout the project, the MVP should be ready without any extra work.

### Landing Page

Create a [landing page](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-a-landing-page/) for your app.  This should be a beautiful and simple single-page site that explains why a user would want to use your app and how to get started.  It should include a link to your live demo.

You are encouraged to write this using only HTML & CSS (/bootstrap/material/...) for simplicity, no need for a full frontend framework.  Your landing page can be hosted from your group repository using GitHub Pages.

### Video Spot

Produce a short (< 2min) video spot explaining your project.  The goal of this spot is to sell your app to new users.  You should not mention the technologies you used, show the code, or talk about how it was built.  You might not even include a screen shot of the app!

Think of the adds you'd see on Youtube, this is what you're aiming for. Be creative, be engagin, be convincing.

### Pitch Deck

Create a short slide show to explain your project in under 2 minutes.  Your audience is a potential user, you will need to convince them of:

- why they want to use your service
- why it is better than other alternatives
- why you are the best team for the job

### Presentation

Finally, your team will need to present all of this on graduation day.  Divide the presentation among yourselves, each team member should speak at least once.  Things you may want to mention in your presentation:

- who is on your team
- what you built and why
  - screen shots of the landing page
  - embed the video spot
- screen shots/gifs of the live demo
- about your journey
  - development process
  - what you learned
  - what was challenging
  - what was fun
  - ...
- ... this is your project, be proud of yourselves :)

## Week 1

In the first week you will become familiar with the starter repository and lay out your plans for the next 4 weeks.  Agile does not mean "no planning"!

You will define your user, plan their journey through your application, develop wireframes, and set up an initial backlog of development tasks.  You will change the plans in the coming weeks as you better understand your team and the project, but that doesn't mean it's wasted time.  That's the agile way.

> ### Agile approach 

#### a-Scrum : 

Scrum is the most common approach to Agile and for good reasons , Scrum rules are easy to learn and straightforward.But,for Scrum to be most effective,teams  need to really understand the values of Scrum and the Agile Manifesto principles, which help
you get into an effective mindset. Because while Scrum seems simple, the way a Scrum team constantly inspects and adapts is a whole new way of thinking about projects. 

Every Scrum project follows the same pattern of behavior, which is defined by a series of timeboxed (sprints) events that always happen in the same order. Here’s what the Scrum pattern looks like : 

- The team use *the product Backlog* to keep trace of the features that they'll build for the whole project.Keep in mind that *the product Backlog* is the single source for requirements and any changes that wll be made will be throw it .

- Every Scrum project is organized into iterations sprints . Many teams use 30-day Sprints, but it’s pretty common to see two-week Sprints too.

- At the beginning of each Sprint,the Scrum Team gets together for a Sprint Planning
session where they choose what items to include in the Sprint.

- The items for the Sprint are pulled off of the *Product Backlog* and added to the *Sprint Backlog*. During the Sprint, all of the development work is focused on building the items in the *Sprint Backlog*

- Every day, the team holds *a Daily Scrum*, a short meeting where each person gives
an update on their progress, what they’ll work on next, and any roadblocks they’ve hit.

- When Sprint is done, the team holds a meeting called the *Sprint Review*, where they meet with the users and give a demo of the working software that they built. 

- The very last thing the team does in the Sprint is meet and hold a *Sprint Retrospective*, where they talk about what happened during the Sprint so they can reproduce the things that went well and learn from any problems.

#### Scrum roles : 

There are three roles must be filled on every Scrum team : 

1- Product owner : The Product Owner helps the team understand *the users needs* so they can *build the most valuable product*. He/She works with the team every day to help them *understand the features in the Product Backlog*: what items are on it and why the users need them. This is a really important job because it helps the team build the most valuable software they can.

2- Scrum master : He/She helps the *development team understand and execute Scrum.* Scrum may be simple to describe, but it’s not always easy to get right.the Scrum Master is a servant leader. This means that the person in this role spends all of his or her time helping (or “serving”) the Product Owner, the Development Team, and people throughout the organization:
> - Helping the product owner find effective ways to manage the backlog
> - Helping the Development Team understand the Scrum events, and facilitating them if needed
> - Helping the rest of the organization to understand Scrum and work with the team
> - Helping everyone do the best job they can to deliver the most valuable software possible.

3- Scrum team : Other people on the team may have different areas of expertise, and
maybe even different job titles , but they all participate in the Scrum events the same way.

#### Scrum artifacts : 

The team needs to know about the product that they’re working on, what they’re building in the current Sprint, and how they’ll get it built. Scrum teams use three artifacts
to manage all of this information: *the Product Backlog*, *the Sprint Backlog*, and *the Increment*.

- **Product Backlog :** every item in the Product Backlog has four attributes: *order*, *description*,*estimate*, and *value*.**The Product Backlog** is never complete as long as the project is running. *The Product Owner* will constantly work with users and stakeholders throughout the company to add, remove, change, and reorder the items in the Product Backlog.

> *Order* : The most important items come first and so on.<br>
> *Estimate* : The time estimated to be done with the items (days).<br>
> *Value* : (description) What will the item add to the product (for example ,it will make the product more fun and responsive ).

- **Sprint Backlog :** Normally consists of the *sprint goal*, the *first part of the sprint planing* and *the second part of the sprint planning*.

> - *Sprint goal* : the objective that will be met by the team by completing the
Sprint planing .

> - *The first part of the sprint planing* : the team determines what can be done in *the Sprint* by choosing which items to include in it.
  
> - *The second  part of the sprint planing* : the team determines how the chosen work will get done by *decomposing the Sprint items into tasks*.

- **The Increment** : The Increment is the sum of *all backlog items* that are actually completed and delivered at the end of the Sprint.Scrum is incremental, which means the project is broken into “chunks” that are delivered one after another. Each of those“chunks” is called an Increment, and each Increment represents the result of one complete Sprint.
